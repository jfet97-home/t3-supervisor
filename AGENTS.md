## Knowledge Base

This project has an LLM-maintained knowledge base in `knowledge/` (git-ignored). Invoke `$knowledge` or `/knowledge` with the same subcommands and arguments.

- When a local knowledge base exists, consult `knowledge/INDEX.md` and relevant pages before reading code. Use `rg` for exact lookup and `qmd query` when available for semantic lookup.
- After meaningful development or pulling commits, use `$knowledge update`.
- Library lookup order: `knowledge/dependencies/`, installed `node_modules/`, then official upstream documentation. Dependency reference sources are read-only and must never be imported.
