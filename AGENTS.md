## Knowledge Base

This project has an LLM-maintained knowledge base in `knowledge/` (git-ignored). Invoke `$knowledge` or `/knowledge` with the same subcommands and arguments.

- When a local knowledge base exists, consult `knowledge/INDEX.md` and relevant pages before reading code. Use `rg` for exact lookup and `qmd query` when available for semantic lookup.
- After meaningful development or pulling commits, use `$knowledge update`.
- Library lookup order: `knowledge/dependencies/`, installed `node_modules/`, then official upstream documentation. Dependency reference sources are read-only and must never be imported.

## Batch completion and deployment

After completing an implementation batch, deploy the completed Supervisor to both
the Mac and T3 Lab VM and activate any associated MCP/MCPX connection changes.
Source checks alone do not complete a batch. Carry out the normal commit/source
synchronization and deployment steps without asking for confirmation again, unless
the current user explicitly limits deployment or a concrete blocker prevents it.
Verify the running revision, relevant health and a bounded real MCP call; preserve
state volumes, credentials, existing thread identities and instance settings.
Update the Lab's current-state, next-steps and progress documents with the outcome.
Choose checks proportionate to the change; do not replay the entire historical
foundation test campaign. Never modify T3 source or its installed app/server.

## Standing rule: no Supervisor proxy workarounds

Do not add or retain extra HTTP proxies, reverse proxies or relay sidecars to make
Supervisor integrations work. Fix endpoint exposure, authentication, accepted hosts
and client configuration in Supervisor itself. MCPX must connect directly to the
Supervisor MCP endpoint. The existing MCPX gateway remains the client connection;
do not introduce another intermediary. The two legacy workflow HTTP proxy services were
removed by the completed direct-authentication batch. Never modify
T3 source or its installed app/server as a workaround.
